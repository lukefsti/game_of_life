# Conway's Enhanced Game of Life with Pygame

This repository contains a variation of the classic Conway's Game of Life implemented using Pygame. It provides an interactive way to observe the game's evolution and influence it by toggling cells or controlling the game's speed.

## ðŸš€ Overview

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Conway. This implementation enhances the traditional game by adding dynamic interaction and a visual appeal through Pygame.

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

- Python
- Pygame
- Numpy

To install the necessary libraries:

```bash```
pip install pygame numpy

## ðŸš€ Setup and Running
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the repositorys root dir in your terminal
3. run the game

## ðŸŽ¨ Features

- Interactive Grid: Toggle cells on and off with a mouse click.
- Game Status Indicator: Display whether the game is running or paused.
- Dynamic Speed Control: Use the keyboard to increase or decrease the evolution speed.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- Click on cells to toggle teir status
- Watch the evolution of the game, observing patterns form and change
- Use keyboard controlls to pause, resume or adjust the game speed.

  Controlls:
  - Space : Pause/Resume
  - Up Arrow: Incease speed
  - Down Arrow: Decrease speed

## ðŸ’¼ Credits
This is a unique take on Conway's Game of Life, designed to demonstrate the power of Pygame and the world of cellular automata in Python. It serves both educational and entertainment purposes, shedding light on the captivating emergence of patterns from simple rules.
